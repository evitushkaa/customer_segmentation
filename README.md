<h1> RFM customer segmetation </h1>
<h3> I have Retail Customer Transactional Data. </h3>
<h3><b>The goal</b> is customer segmetation based on this data. </h3>
<h4> In classical marketing, there is a methodology for <b><i>RFM analysis</i></b>, which is used to predict customer behavior based on his past actions. RFM is an abbreviation of the words Recency (novelty), Frequency (frequency), Monetary (attachments).
 <ul>
<li>Recency - this is the time that has passed since the last activity of the client, whether it’s a purchase, a link or just opening an email.</li>
<li>Frequency - the number of actions performed by the client.</li>
<li>Cash - cash costs of the client for the goods and services of the company.</li>
  </ul>
 <h2> Working process </h2>
For segmentation I used KMeans algorithm.
 <h3>h2 Result</h3>
 <p>I've got <b>8 segments</b> of customer. This information can help the company <b><i>develop a marketing strategy with an individual approach </i></b> to each segment. Thus, save on the “dead” and <b><i>make more money</i><b/> on the “living”.
In fairness, it should be noted that this is not only about business profits. In a sense, RFM analysis increases the value of a consumer’s life. Here, as they say, </p>
 <p><b>“A happy customer is a useful customer.”</b></p>
