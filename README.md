<h1> RFM customer segmetation </h1>
<h2> I have Retail Customer Transactional Data. </h2>
<h2> **The goal** is customer segmetation based on this data. </h2>
<h4> In classical marketing, there is a methodology for **RFM analysis**, which is used to predict customer behavior based on his past actions. RFM is an abbreviation of the words Recency (novelty), Frequency (frequency), Monetary (attachments).
* ***Recency*** - this is the time that has passed since the last activity of the client, whether it’s a purchase, a link or just opening an email.
* ***Frequency*** - the number of actions performed by the client.
* ***Cash*** - cash costs of the client for the goods and services of the company.</h4>
h2 Working process 
For segmentation I used KMeans algorithm.
h2 Result
I've got **8 segments** of customer. This information can help the company ***develop a marketing strategy with an individual approach*** to each segment. Thus, save on the “dead” and ***make more money*** on the “living”.
In fairness, it should be noted that this is not only about business profits. In a sense, RFM analysis increases the value of a consumer’s life. Here, as they say, 
**“A happy customer is a useful customer.”**
